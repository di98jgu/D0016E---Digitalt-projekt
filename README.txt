INTRO
If you are a stranger, welcome to this project. Feel free to let
us know what you think about our project.

We who run this project here at GitHub are students. The main language 
is swedish but all comments in the code is in English. 

The goal with this assignment is do a "real" project, something that 
have a actual user at the end. 


BACKGROUND
The Swedish city Skellefteå have as goal to be a "smart city". This 
means that technology will be used to improve service to citizens 
and utilise resources more efficiently.

With a snow depth of 120 mm on average, snow is a real danger to 
buildings and humans. Several factors affect snow pressure, humidity, depth
and temperature. An established system exists to measure and collect data.

The purpose of this Android app is to monitor the collected data. A 
property owner, for a example, subscribe to a number of data points. 
A point is a position and a set of data. He can see the collected data 
at each point and if data exceeds certain thresholds, the app will 
alert him.
